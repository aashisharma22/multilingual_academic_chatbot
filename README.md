# multilingual_academic_chatbot
A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.
We have created a voice-based chatbot that aides students in their day-to-day educational activities; mainly academic doubts in the language of their preference.
This Chatbot has three major functions:

**i)For Students not proficient in English**: We all know that majority of educational websites support English and Hindi as their main languages. But what if a student who doesn't know the mainstream languages want to clarify a doubt!! That's where this Chatbot helps in. Since it is completely voice-based, the student need not know the text written on the screen. The student has to say the input language(the language in which they'll ask the doubt) of their preference. The Chatterbot will then ask the student to say the output language(the language that the chatterbot will use to converse) of their preference. Then they can enter their doubt in text form of their native language. The chatterbot translates the language into English, scrapes the web for all information regarding the question(using keywords extraction and Natural Language Processing) and again translates back to the output language preferred. It displays the answer as well as speaks-out the answer back to the user.

**ii)For people wanting to learn new languages**:
